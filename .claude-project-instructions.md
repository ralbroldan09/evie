# Evie Project Instructions

## Project Overview

You are working on **Evie**, a specialized mobile application for hands-free, voice-activated text messaging. Evie enables users to send pre-set text messages to designated contacts using custom voice keywords.

## Core Product Details

### What Evie Does

- Listens continuously for pre-defined voice keywords using on-device technology (Porcupine/Pico)
- Automatically sends pre-set text messages when keywords are detected
- Links specific keywords to specific messages and contacts
- Operates hands-free without confirmation steps once keyword is spoken

### Platform Capabilities

- **Android**: Full hands-free operation (always listening in background)
- **iOS**: Requires "Hey Siri, open Evie" first, then keyword detection works
- Must be open/active to function properly

### Setup Process

1. User assigns a keyword to a specific text message
2. Links that message to a designated contact
3. When keyword is spoken, message automatically sends to linked contact

## Target Market & Use Cases

### Primary Target: Accessibility-Focused Users

- Seniors with arthritis, tremors, or joint stiffness
- Users with motor disabilities (MS, ALS, cerebral palsy)
- People with neurological conditions affecting hand control
- Individuals recovering from injuries (casts, surgeries)
- Visually impaired users relying on voice-first tools

### Key Scenarios

- New parent holding sleeping baby, can't reach phone
- Elderly person with tremors who can't type reliably
- Person with motor disability needing quick status updates
- Caregiver with hands occupied during patient care
- Anyone who sends repetitive messages frequently

### Secondary Markets

- Busy professionals sending routine updates
- People in situations where hands are occupied (cooking, driving, working out)
- Users seeking to reduce screen time through voice automation

## Competitive Positioning

### Advantages Over Existing Solutions

- **Faster**: Single keyword vs multi-step Siri/Assistant commands
- **Customizable**: Users choose their own trigger words and messages
- **Offline-capable**: Works without internet connection
- **No confirmation needed**: Immediate sending without taps or verbal confirmation
- **Accessibility-first design**: Built specifically for users with mobility challenges

### Key Differentiators

- Dedicated single-purpose focus (not general voice assistant)
- Always-on keyword detection without "Hey Siri" activation
- Automatic sending without user interaction after keyword
- Simplified setup compared to complex automation tools

## Technical Requirements & Constraints

### Core Technologies

- Voice keyword detection (Porcupine/Pico for on-device processing)
- SMS/messaging integration with comprehensive error handling
- Contact management system with accessibility focus
- Local data storage for offline functionality

### Platform-Specific Implementation

- **Android**: Background listening service, notification management
- **iOS**: Siri Shortcuts integration, foreground-focused design
- **Cross-platform**: React Native with platform-specific optimizations

### Accessibility Requirements (CRITICAL)

- Minimum 44px touch targets for all interactive elements
- High contrast colors: #1A1A1A background, #FFFFFF text, #FFA500 accent
- Screen reader compatibility (TalkBack/VoiceOver)
- Voice feedback for all actions and status changes
- Simple, predictable navigation patterns
- Clear error messages in plain language
- Support for assistive technologies

### Privacy & Security

- All voice processing must be on-device (no cloud)
- Secure local storage of contact and message data
- Transparent data handling for vulnerable user base
- Optional data export/backup capabilities

## Development Guidelines

### Code Standards

- TypeScript strict mode required
- Comprehensive error handling for all user flows
- Graceful degradation when permissions denied
- Extensive logging for debugging voice recognition issues
- Performance optimization for continuous listening

### User Experience Principles

- **Simplicity over features**: Every UI element must have clear purpose
- **Reliability first**: App must work consistently for users who depend on it
- **Immediate feedback**: Users need to know when keywords are detected
- **Error recovery**: Clear guidance when things go wrong
- **Customization**: Allow users to adapt app to their specific needs

### Testing Requirements

- Test with real users who have mobility challenges
- Validate voice recognition across different speech patterns
- Ensure app works reliably in various noise environments
- Test battery usage during continuous listening
- Verify accessibility compliance with automated and manual testing

## Business Context

### Value Proposition

"Evie lets you text someone with one word â€” no tapping, no typing, no navigating."

### Success Metrics

- Keyword detection accuracy >95% for target users
- Message sending reliability >99%
- Setup completion rate >80% for first-time users
- User retention focused on daily active usage
- Positive feedback from accessibility community

## When Providing Development Assistance

### Always Consider

- How will this work for someone with limited hand mobility?
- Can this be operated entirely by voice if needed?
- Is the visual design high-contrast and accessible?
- Does this maintain user privacy and security?
- Will this work reliably for someone who depends on it?

### Code Review Checklist

- Accessibility props on all interactive elements
- Error handling for voice recognition failures
- Platform-specific optimizations where needed
- Performance impact of continuous voice monitoring
- Clear user feedback for all state changes
- Offline functionality preserved

### Focus Areas for MVP

- Single keyword detection with high accuracy
- Reliable SMS sending with delivery confirmation
- Simple setup flow that accessibility users can complete
- Clear visual and audio feedback for all actions
- Comprehensive error handling and recovery

Remember: Evie is not just another voice app - it's an accessibility tool that could significantly improve quality of life for people with mobility challenges. Every decision should be evaluated through this lens of empowering users who face physical barriers to traditional smartphone interaction.
