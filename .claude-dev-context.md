# Evie Development Context

## Current Development Environment

- **OS**: Windows development environment
- **Primary Platform**: Android (full background capabilities)
- **Secondary Platform**: iOS (Siri-activated mode)
- **IDE**: Cursor with Claude Code integration
- **Language**: TypeScript (strict mode)
- **Framework**: React Native

## MVP Scope (Phase 1)

- Single keyword detection ("sunshine")
- One message to one contact configuration
- Android-focused development
- Basic accessibility compliance
- Local storage only (no cloud dependencies)

## Key Technical Decisions

- Porcupine for keyword detection (on-device, offline)
- react-native-send-sms for messaging
- AsyncStorage for configuration persistence
- React Navigation for simple screen flow
- No external APIs or cloud services for MVP

## Accessibility Color Scheme (Mandatory)

- Background: #1A1A1A (Dark Gray/Almost Black)
- Primary Text: #FFFFFF (White)
- Secondary Text: #B0B0B0 (Light Gray)
- Primary Accent: #FFA500 (Vibrant Orange/Gold)
- Secondary Accent: #ADD8E6 (Light Blue)
- Minimum contrast ratio: 4.5:1 for all text

## Architecture Patterns

- Services for business logic (VoiceService, MessageService)
- Hooks for state management (useVoiceDetection, usePermissions)
- Components focused on accessibility and simplicity
- Clear separation between platform-specific code
